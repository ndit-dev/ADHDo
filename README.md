# ADHDo - Your Dynamic To-Do List

ADHDo is a to-do list application designed to help my self cater the needs of my everyday life. I cloud not find a good to-do list that suited my needs, so I desided to create my own.
It is/will be docker container hosting a web app written in python flask intended to host locally in my home network.

I created this for my self, mainly hosting it on gitbub for the benefits of version control etc. But feel free to use it if you find it useful.
